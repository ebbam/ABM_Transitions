    abstract = {This paper discusses the creation of an artificial labor market (ALM) as an agent-based simulation model. We trace the development of the ALM by adapting the traditional simulation life cycle into two main parts: the model phase and the simulation phase. In the modeling phase of the life cycle, we focus upon agent representation and specification within the virtual world. In the simulation phase, we discuss the use of scenario planning as the experimentation vehicle. Throughout, we use military recruit market as an example to illustrate the methodology. The benefits of the ALM are (1) it provides a virtual world for continuous computational experimentation, (2) it supports market segmentation by allowing "drilldowns" to finer and finer levels of granularity, and (3) when connected via a common OLAP interface to a "real world" counterpart, it facilitates a tightly integrated, persistent, "sense and respond" decision support functionality. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

    abstract = {The future of work is increasingly uncertain. With new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the transition to a green economy driving unprecedented change, workers are navigating an evolving labor market that is constantly being pushed out of equilibrium. While labor economics has traditionally emphasized the importance of labor market efficiency, this chapter stresses the importance of analyzing the resilience of labor markets in the face of disruption. We discuss how a complexity-based approach opens up new and important avenues for studying the labor market from an evolutionary perspective, and we highlight recent work that has combined increasingly granular occupational data with network analysis, agent-based modeling, machine learning and other techniques to provide important and policy-relevant insights into labor market resilience. This approach is especially advantageous for modeling transition periods of significant job disruption when labor markets are constantly changing. During economic change, these models can simulate policy outcomes before they are implemented, thus offering the best opportunity to shape resilience through policy interventions.},

    abstract = {Economic agent-based models (ABMs) are becoming more and more data-driven, establishing themselves as increasingly valuable tools for economic research and policymaking. We propose to classify the extent to which an ABM is data-driven based on whether agent-level quantities are initialized from real-world micro-data and whether the ABM's dynamics track empirical time series. This paper discusses how making ABMs data-driven helps overcome limitations of traditional ABMs and makes ABMs a stronger alternative to equilibrium models. We review state-of-the-art methods in parameter calibration, initialization, and data assimilation, and then present successful applications that have generated new scientific knowledge and informed policy decisions. This paper serves as a manifesto for data-driven ABMs, introducing a definition and classification and outlining the state of the field, and as a guide for those new to the field.},

    abstract = {Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are used in several fields to study the evolution of complex systems from micro-level assumptions. However, a significant drawback of ABMs is their inability to estimate agent-specific (or “micro”) variables, which hinders their ability to make accurate predictions using micro-level data. In this paper, we propose a protocol to learn the latent micro-variables of an ABM from data. We begin by translating an ABM into a probabilistic model characterized by a computationally tractable likelihood. Next, we use a gradient-based expectation maximization algorithm to maximize the likelihood of the latent variables. We showcase the efficacy of our protocol on an ABM of the housing market, where agents with different incomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods. Our protocol produces accurate estimates of the latent variables while preserving the general behavior of the ABM. Moreover, our estimates substantially improve the out-of-sample forecasting capabilities of the ABM compared to simpler heuristics. Our protocol encourages modelers to articulate assumptions, consider the inferential process, and spot potential identification problems, thus making it a useful alternative to black-box data assimilation methods.},
